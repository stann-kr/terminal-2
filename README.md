# terminal-2 — STANN OS LIVE

terminal-2 is the STANN OS LIVE surface for `https://terminal.stann.kr`.

## Event experience

`/` and `/home` open the event overview. The optional boot/sleep experience is available at `/?experience=terminal`. Event selection prefers live events, then the nearest upcoming event, then the latest past event. Dates are displayed in Korea Standard Time. Gate and Lineup preserve the selected event in `?event=`.

The interface uses a full-screen black-and-orange workspace with seven directory entries, fixed navigation, and internal content scrolling. Pages redraw inside the same terminal display; event and artist selections redraw their own readouts. Text stays in place, and keyboard or pointer input immediately completes the visual redraw. The Home time display follows the featured event's start time. Artist profiles can be linked with `/lineup?event=…&artist=…`; changing the event clears its artist selection. Guest requests show a receipt only after the server accepts the submission. A receipt does not confirm admission.

Home uses a lightweight ASCII brand treatment. WebGL is loaded only for the optional terminal experience, subject to motion preferences, visibility, and device support.

## Local development

Node.js 22 or newer is required.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Default dev URL:

```text
http://localhost:3005
```

## Verification

Run these before treating the project as healthy:

```bash
npm audit --omit=dev
npm run db:check-history
npm test
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run smoke:http
npm run build:worker
npm run test:d1
npx wrangler deploy --env production --dry-run
```

For Worker HTTP smoke, run `npm run cf:preview` and then run `SMOKE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 SMOKE_API=1 npm run smoke:http` in another terminal.

`npm run build` intentionally runs `scripts/check-token-sync.mjs` first through the `prebuild` hook. This confirms the local STANN OS token copy at `app/stann-os.css` matches the expected canonical token hash.

`npm ci` applies and verifies the bundled `use-scramble` security patch. The same check runs after a regular `npm install`.

## Cloudflare / OpenNext

Build an environment-specific Cloudflare Worker bundle:

```bash
npm run build:worker:development
npm run build:worker:production
```

Run the development configuration in a local Cloudflare preview:

```bash
npm run cf:preview
```

Deployment targets are explicit:

```bash
npm run deploy:development
npm run deploy:production
```

Cloudflare Workers Builds is the only automatic deployment path. A `dev` push deploys the fixed `terminal-2-dev` Worker and a `main` push deploys the production `terminal-2` Worker. GitHub Actions performs validation only.

Important: production deployment requires separate approval. D1 migrations, secrets, bindings, and routes are not automatically changed by Worker code deployment and must be applied and verified as separate operations.

## D1

Configuration:

- `wrangler.toml`
- `drizzle.config.ts`
- `lib/db/schema.ts`
- `migrations/*.sql`
- `migrations/meta/*.json`
- `scripts/migration-history.lock.json`

D1 binding name:

```text
DB
```

Remote databases are separated by environment:

- development: `terminal-db-dev`
- production: `terminal-db`

The repository history currently contains 10 continuous migrations, `0000` through `0009`. Migration `0009_normalize_transmit_created_at.sql` rebuilds `transmit_logs.created_at` as ISO timestamp `TEXT NOT NULL` after normalizing supported legacy values.

Migration history is append-only. Before validation or generation, the guard requires continuous unique SQL prefixes, exact journal/SQL tags, one snapshot per SQL file with a valid `id`/`prevId` chain, and exact path + SHA-256 matches against the lock:

```bash
npm run db:check-history
```

Generate a schema migration only through the guarded wrapper with an explicit lowercase snake_case name:

```bash
npm run db:generate -- --name add_example_column
```

The wrapper validates the current structure and lock, stages Drizzle output outside the repository, requires the next prefix, permits only the journal update plus one new SQL and snapshot, preserves every existing migration file, and then atomically advances the lock. Do not run `drizzle-kit generate` or `npx drizzle-kit generate` directly. `npm run db:lock-history` is only for creating the initial lock after a complete, reviewed reconciliation; it refuses to replace an existing lock.

Local migration apply example with an explicit environment:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --env development --local
```

Development and production remote histories are separate. Inspect and apply each target independently; applying one environment is not evidence that the other is current:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations list DB --env development --remote
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --env development --remote

npx wrangler d1 migrations list DB --env production --remote
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --env production --remote
```

Every remote apply is a database write and requires separate approval plus environment-specific preflight and post-apply verification. Worker deployment never applies D1 migrations automatically.

## Public write endpoints

These routes accept public writes and must be protected by validation, body guards, and abuse controls before high-traffic public use:

- `POST /api/gate/request`
- `POST /api/signal`
- `POST /api/transmit`

`POST /api/gate/code-info` and `POST /api/gate/request` require the displayed `eventId` in the JSON body. The server independently selects the eligible event. Missing IDs return `400 EVENT_ID_REQUIRED`; changed targets return `409 EVENT_MISMATCH`; no eligible upcoming event returns `404 NO_UPCOMING_EVENT`. Clients must refresh and review the event before retrying, preserving the draft. Older clients without an event ID must reload.

Current local contracts include exact JSON media-type and streaming byte guards, runtime DTO validation, a Cloudflare rate-limit binding interface, and a server-side Turnstile validator. Broad public launch still requires the real binding/secret, client token flow, and verified Signal unsubscribe/retention operations.
